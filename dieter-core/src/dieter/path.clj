;;; Dieter uses many different types of paths, and it can be confusing at times.
;;; We try to use a sort-of hungarian notation, where every path has a type
;;; included in its variable name somehow.

;;; A "path" refers to paths of any kind, including filenames, uris, adrfs, etc.

;;; An "Asset-directory-relative filename" (adrf) represents a path, relative
;;; to the asset directory. It is used as a canonical representation, and can
;;; easily by created from URIs and filenames from directory traversals. It can
;;; also easily be converted into any of these types of file. It does not
;;; include the string "/assets/".

;;; A URI represents the part of the URI that we use in dieter. If a whole URI
;;; is prototcol://hostname/path, then we use URI to represent just the "path"
;;; portion. In dieter, all URIs will start with "/assets/", as otherwise they
;;; won't be handled by dieter.

;;; A filename represents an actual file on the filesystem. We'll try and keep
;;; them as absolute strings names, because relative ones are easy to confuse
;;; with other types.
